# web-programming-assignments

Hi there! This repo consists of snippets of work that I have done for my school assignments (specifically, ICT239). The main languages used are javascript and python through the use of the flask flamework, with the use of HTML and CSS for the HTML views.

Here is a short description of what is in this repo:
## Static demo of a chat application
#### Question 1 - barebones static chat application [Link](Jan_2019_Web_Programming/q1)
- A static chat application.
- A button was created to allow input of new chats, with attributes such as Name, Status and Message
- 2 buttons were created that allows CSS design changes to parts of the chat history
- Utilized: HTML, CSS, Javascript

#### Question 2 - Using Flask and the MVC framework for implementation [Link](Jan_2019_Web_Programming/q2)
- Changed the functionality of the buttons
- Addition of a REST web API (Flask API)
- Conversation data stored in a Python dictionary
- AJAX call using jQuery to change list attributes
- Utilized: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, Flask framework

## A simple reporting dashboard 
#### Question 3 - Simple table showing report results [Link](Jan_2019_Web_Programming/q3)
- Creation of a basic table to show limited number of results on the dashboard's first page
- A button to load the next 10 records when clicked
- Sorting via clicking of table headers
- Delete feature via a checkbox
- Utilized: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, Flask framework

#### Question 4 - Chart with visualization [Link](Jan_2019_Web_Programming/q4)
- An add on to question 3
- A visual interactive line chart to show different types of data
- A visual stacked bar charts to show specific data
  - Note: Due to being unfamiliar with javascript at the time, although I was able to generate the results on the backend through Flask, I was unable to convert the data sent to the HTML view into the correct format to be read by the ChartJS library.
- Utilized: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Python, Flask framework, ChartJS Library
